# jquery-yql
An easy-to-use yql plugin for jquery with templating inspired by jquery-rss (https://github.com/sdepold/jquery-rss)

## Backstory
I've been fiddling with this plugin all through 2017 and '18 so that I could use it to manage some of the listings on my website.
Eventually got it to Alpha (usable with some quirks status) and started using it on my site but still wasn't satisfied as I hadn't
really gone TDD on this side-project. So I started on that and now we're in 2019! and whaddya know YQL has been shutdown by Yahoo.
So now the project is useless. 
In any case, I decided to publish to github if anyone needs to see a recent-ish project by me (however incomplete), and I hope it
doesn't bring shame to my name.
